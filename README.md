### Recreate the BIClass database

- This is a collection of stored procedures that drop and recreate a star schema with the proper constraints and relationships within an existing database.

- Note that MAIN.sql contains all project code, but it is not sufficient to run MAIN.sql to recreate the star schema.

- There are conditions that must be met before many of the procedures can be executed (certain columns need be added, tables created, etc)

- TODO: add STEP1, STEP2, STEP3 .sql files that contain the code properly organized to achieve the end result.
